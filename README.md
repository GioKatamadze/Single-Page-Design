## My process

1. Change background color of body
2. Add background color
3. Create wrapper divs
4. Add elements and text
5. Give elements sizes and styles in CSS
6. Create hover effects for buttons
7. Add slider
8. Add Javascript code to make slider functional

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile first approach
- Flexbox
- Grid
- Media Queries
- Vanilla Javascript

### What I learned

While working on this project, I gained more practise of using CSS, the main challenge that I overcame was to create Js Functionality for the APP. After research and practicing different ways for resolving this step, I wrote the code usng pure CSS and Vanilla Js, that gave website the same design result as it was shown in figma design and slider become functional for any display size

### Continued development

I want to create other projects like this to finally master coding and make more dynamic, interactive and functional projects
